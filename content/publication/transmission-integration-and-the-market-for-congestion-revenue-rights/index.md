abstract: Texas electricity market saw a recent integration of electricity
  transmission as a part of Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ).
  Exploiting the commissioning date of CREZ based transmission integration as an
  exogenous shock, we analyze the effect of transmission expansion on market
  clearing prices of Congestion Revenue Rights (CRR). Reduced form estimates
  suggest that excess transmission led to a lowering of CRR prices for contracts
  at all Times of Use. We find strong evidence of spatial, distributional, and
  firm specific heterogeneity. The paper shows that transmission expansion
  enhanced efficiency of the CRR market in terms of a spatial convergence in
  prices and a decrease in aggregate auction expenditure of approximately $260
  million over a period of 4.5 years post CREZ.
