abstract="This chapter explores the reasons behind trade growth in goods and services over the years for some selected countries by using Novy's measure. We calculate trade costs in terms of tariff equivalents by using the indirect trade cost measure given by Novy. Trade costs and trade growth accounting in both goods and services are shown separately. For trade costs in goods, we look at the case of India and APEC countries, and for trade costs in services we consider the 61 trading partners for which data is available.",
