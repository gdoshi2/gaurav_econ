abstract: This chapter explores the reasons behind trade growth in goods and
  services over the years for some selected countries by using Novyâ€™s measure.
  We calculate trade costs in terms of tariff equivalents by using the indirect
  trade cost measure given by Novy. Trade costs and trade growth accounting in
  both goods and services are shown separately. For trade costs in goods, we
  look at the case of India and APEC countries, and for trade costs in services
  we consider the 61 trading partners for which data is available.
