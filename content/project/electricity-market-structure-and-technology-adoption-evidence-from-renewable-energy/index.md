This paper examines the effects of electricity market deregulation and long term contracting on technology adoption. Using data on all US solar and wind projects from 2001-2020, we estimate models of technology adoption as a function of market structure and other characteristics. Results indicate that solar projects in deregulated markets are 15 percent less likely to adopt tracking panels than projects in regulated markets. For the wind industry, we find that long term contracting plays a major role in technology adoption. We do not find evidence that competition promotes technology adoption, but it may hinder adoption if it reduces the use of long-term contracts.
