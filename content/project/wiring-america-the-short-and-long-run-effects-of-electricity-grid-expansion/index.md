summary: Electricity grid expansion is a key policy tool to accelerate the
  transition to green energy and lower carbon emissions. I study the impact of
  grid expansion on market power and emissions from the fossil fuel industry in
  the short-run and investment in wind energy in the long-run. [**Job Market

Expanding the power grid is a key factor to achieve decarbonization and fully utilize the benefits of renewable energy. This paper examines the impact of large-scale grid expansion on price-cost markups and emissions from fossil fuel generators in the short-run and wind investment in the long-run. I focus on the rollout of a grid expansion project that linked windy areas in west Texas to population centers in the east. Results suggest moderate declines in markups and emissions with total annual benefits of roughly $285 million. Counties that received investment in transmission infrastructure saw higher wind capacity in the long-run, avoiding $271 million worth of carbon emissions in 2019. These findings highlight the potential to unlock large economic benefits from transmission expansion across the US.
