The US needs massive investments in expanding the power grid to decarbonize in the following decades. This paper examines the impact of large-scale grid expansion on price-cost markups and emissions from fossil fuel generators in the short-run and wind investment in the long-run. I focus on the rollout of a grid expansion project that linked windy areas in west Texas to population centers in the east. Results suggest moderate declines in markups and emissions with total annual benefits of roughly $100 million. Counties that received investment in transmission infrastructure saw significantly higher wind capacity (+202%) in the long-run, preventing $271 million worth of carbon emissions in 2019. However, growing wind generation but fixed transmission capacity in Texas has led to higher wind curtailments near these counties. This could reduce the potential gains from transmission expansion.
