According to the Net-Zero America study, the US needs to triple its electricity grid in order to decarbonize by 2050 (Larson et al. 2021). This paper examines the impact of large scale grid expansion on price-cost markups, emissions from fossil fuel generators, and wind investment. I focus on the rollout of a grid expansion project that linked windy areas in west Texas to population centers in the east. I find moderate declines in markups and emissions with total annual benefits of roughly $100 million in the short-run. Counties that received investment in transmission infrastructure saw significantly higher wind capacity (+202%) in the long-run, preventing $271 million worth of carbon emissions in 2019. Investments in grid level storage and grid-upgrades can be useful in enhancing the benefits of transmission expansion.
